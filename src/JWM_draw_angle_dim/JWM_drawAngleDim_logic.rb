#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

##++JWM Logic version history
#      v4.14 - Filled text black, and lifted it 0.005 * @radius off dimension plane to reduce z-fighting if on face.
#                 Have also filled closed arrow black, but left it on surface. Lifting it disp lays poorly from some angles
#                 - noticeably out of line with arc end.
#                 Could perhaps stop arc short at middle of arrowhead for closed arrow only?
#                 Added right angle lines, and hid arcs, arrowheads and text for right angles. Not sure how to scale
#                   the lines, and/or whether to keep text displayed instead of hidden
#      v4.13 - Arrowhead now selectable simply by changing value of @arrow_style in initialize function
#                 (but may need to restart SU?)
#      v4.12 - Outside angles working properly, including text angle
#      v4.11 - Outside angle arcs and arrowheads correctly drawn, and text correctly placed but incorrectly oriented wrt screen
#      v4.10 - Text that won't fit in dimension angle correctly positioned and oriented, AND you can choose which side of the angle
#                 external text for small angles is put - it goes at the first picked end
#      v4.09 - Text that won't fit in dimension angle now correctly positioned and oriented at start
#                 though I can't understand quite why it needs 90 deg different rotation from text inside angle
#      v4.08 - Moved make_arrowhead into a function, and reordered some of the steps for future use
#      v4.07 - tests whether whole dimension, only text, or neither, will fit inside dimension lines
#              and puts arrows and if necessary text, outside dimension lines.
#              Have still to rename vector to text position, to get the orientation of text correct on screen after move to vertex
#
#      v4.06 - senses dimension angle bisector relative to screen orientation,
#              and rotates text accordingly in 90 degree increments.
#              Removed text fill, which caused Z-fighting. Removed test display of angle bisector
#
#      v4.05 - now sensing direction of vertex relative to screen - using view.screen_coords, and rotating text 180 degrees if nec.
#      v4.04 - partially working detection of direction of vertex, to rotate text if needed
#      v4.03 - working with SLB transformation matrix, and three arrow styles implemented. Text can still be upside down
#      v4.02 - partially working
#      v4.01 - SLB code adapted for namespace change to JWM - works except not finding Images and Resources
#              but works if those folders are placed in Plugins in a folder JWM_draw_angle_dim
